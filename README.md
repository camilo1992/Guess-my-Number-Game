## Some Dom manipulation and html classes

```sh
cursor: pointer; ---->
```

The cursor CSS property sets the type of mouse cursor, if any, to show when the mouse pointer is over an element.

useful when we want to change the way the pinter looks when hovering over a button or an image.

e.g

```sh
cursor: not-allowed
- it displays an stop sign
cursor: grab
-It displays a hand
```
